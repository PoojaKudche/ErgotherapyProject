# ProjectforErgotherapy

To begin, add all the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

npm install

This will install all the dependencies given in package.json file.

To run the project, use an Android simulator in Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)

Alternatively, you can install Expo Go application in your Android device. Once the installation is finished, create an account in the app and sign in.

Run your project from Visual Studio Code, by writing the following command in the terminal:

npm start

This command will open up the Metro Bundler in your web browser. Now, go to the Expo Go app in your device and press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or on the left panel of the Metro Bundler.
The project will now open in your device and you are good to make any changes!! :)
